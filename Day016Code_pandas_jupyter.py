#   2020-06-27
#
#   Pandas is used to analize data
#     Will need a libraary to work with Pandas
#        use the following command on the command line:
#              pip3 install pandas
#     Also installing IPython - enhanced Python interactive shell
#              pip3 install ipython
#     I had to install ipython to be able to access it:
#          sudo apt install ipython3
#    Installing jupyter notebook
#          pip3 install jupyter
#          sudo snap install jupyter
#   Jupyter runs from the command line in the current folder with:
#        jupyter notebook
#     CTL + ENTER --- executes jupyter code 
#
#
