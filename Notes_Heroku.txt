These notes are for Heroku___________

Installation:
-------------
Created an account at heroku.com
Installed the Heroku tool belt from the command line:
    karl@StanLee:~/github/100DaysOfCode$ sudo snap install --classic heroku
    Note - git is part of the heroku tool belt

Notes:
------
The following is all from the command line:
  heroku login <-- log in happened automatically through FireFox
  heroku create ksmith-site  <-- creates and app - if name is available
  heroku apps <-- lists apps

  In browser to visit app - https://ksmith-site.herokuapp.com/

Heroku requires a requirements.txt to establish a list of required packages.
  This list is generate with pip3 freeze
  **** Note - this should come from your virtual python environment.  I don't
              have a virtual environment.  I used my development environment
              but only got the packages listed on the instructors pip freeze.

  I installed gunicorn - pip3 install gunicorn
    this is an http server that heroku needs

Created a procfile <-- no extension
   procfile only contains the following line:

      BAD ----- web:  gunicorn script1:app

      web:  gunicorn Day029Code_webssite02:app

      This tell heroku to use gunicorn as a web server and script1:app is the
         app line for flask in the website file

 Create runtime.txt file  <-- contains python version
   check to see what runtimes are supported:
       https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes

I changed to the file with my website and created a repository
   karl@StanLee:~/github/100DaysOfCode/Files/website$ git init

I moved all the website related file to the this location.

   git add .  <-- add files to the current directory

   git commit -m "first commint for horoku site"

   heroku git:remote --app ksmith-site   <-- point to the app

   git push heroku master

   heroku open  <-- opens the browser from command line

   heroku info <-- get info about current app


   **** is looked like all went well but it didn't - time to trouble shoot

   heroku logs --tail  <-- view run time logs

      Found now web dynos running.

    heroku ps  <--- check status of web dynos

        No dynos are on

    heroku ps:scale web=1  <-- add a dyno

        it looks like my procfile was wrong

  To push changes to heroku

    git add .
    git commmit -m "note goes here"

    This only update the 2to file I changed but also shows a deletion?

    git push heroku master
