These notes are for Python as I am using it on Ubuntu

  in the python interactive shell:
    use dir(folium) to get a list of objects
      help(folium.map) --- will show what can be passed to the map object
    scroll there is a lot of info there
     Q - to exit help

To set up a virtual python environment to keep things clean
This did not work
       pip3 install virtualenv <---- this did not work

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

the following command will create a virtual Folder
python3 -m venv virtual_python_site
