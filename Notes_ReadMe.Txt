If for some reason you find this file and opened to read it I thank you.

My Notes_*******.txt files are keeping track of my notes while learning to code.

I have been struggling with how to keep track of all the little snippets of
information I have been accumulating while learning to code.  To be more
accurate relearning.  The first time was learning COBOL in the late 90s when
the computers and coding were different.

Bonus note:  I feel compelled to keep lines under 80 characters
