Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode Repository.

The files in this repository are not intended to be complete functioning programs.

My intent is to have snippets of code with a lot of notes for reference so I can refer back to concepts
that I learned while taking the 100DaysOfCode challenge.  ---- https://www.100daysofcode.com/

If you happen to find this please feel free to reach out me.
